    description = Wernher and Bill were able to determine the orbit of Sputnik just by analyzing the beep signals that it sent out. A long evening at the bar later, they came up with a cunning plan: if they can calculate the unknown orbit of a satellite just by listening to it from known positions on the ground and analyzing the doppler shift effect. Can they do the same the other way around? They think that - in theroy - it should be possible to determine your position on the ground just by listening to satellites passing by on known orbits. Lets go and find out if that works!
    synopsis = Launch a satellite with a TRANSIT transmitter on a trajectory that will pass over Wernhers Sentry. The Satellite must be visible from the location at a minimum elevation above the horizon, and it has to pass in such a way that the radial velocity (the velocity of the satellite in relation to the location on the ground) changes fast enough so that Wernher can use the doppler shift effect to validate his theory.
    completedMessage = It worked! With enough of those satellites we can turn this into a global positioning system!
