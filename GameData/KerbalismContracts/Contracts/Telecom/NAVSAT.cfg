    title = Navy Navigation Satellite System
    description = The Transit system, also known as NAVSAT or NNSS was the first satellite navigation system to be used operationally. Its main mission was to provide accurate location information for vessels on the surface, as well as for hydrographic survey and geodetic surveying. The technique was based on the doppler shift effect of radio signals emitted by satellites with known orbits. (The reverse technique had been used to determine the orbit of Sputnik.)
    synopsis = Build a constellation of satellites that will ensure a satellite pass over the given ground locations at least once every hour, in such a way that ground stations can observe a significatn doppler shift effect (maintain a significant relative speed OR radial velocity to the ground stations during the pass).
    completedMessage = Well done! Transit provided continuous navigation satellite service from 1964, initially for submarines and later for civilian use as well. It was made obsolete by the Global Positioning System (GPS), and ceased navigation service in 1996.
