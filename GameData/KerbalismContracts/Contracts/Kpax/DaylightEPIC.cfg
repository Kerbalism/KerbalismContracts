  name = KerbalismContracts_DaylightEPIC
  agent = KerbalismKpax
  group = KerbalismKpax
  title = Daylight Enhanced Polychromatic Imaging
  description = Imagery from EPIC can be used in science applications to measure ozone amounts, aerosol amounts, cloud height and phase, vegetation properties, hotspot land properties (a view of the land from angles where shadows are a minimum) and UV radiation estimates at Earth's surface. This data is of interest to climate science, as well as hydrology, biogeochemistry and ecology. It also provides insight into Earthâ€™s energy balance.
  synopsis = Provide EPIC data of the surface while shadows are a minimum, over a duration of 180 days.
  completedMessage = Great work! This data will be very useful for further research.
