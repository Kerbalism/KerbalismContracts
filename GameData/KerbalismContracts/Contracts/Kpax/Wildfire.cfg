    title = Observe a Wildfire to Aid Firefighters
    description =  The first moments after a fire ignites are critical. When intense winds combine with dry fuel conditions, the response time can mean the difference between a catastrophic fire, and one that is quickly contained. You are tasked with building a global satellite constellation for varioius surface observations, including the detection and mapping of wild fires in remote areas.
    synopsis = Track the development of a wildfire from low orbit: provide up-to-date VIIRS data of the marked wild fire at least once every 4 hours during two weeks.
    completedMessage = Thanks to your support the wildfire could be contained. Keep those satellites, we'll need them again!
