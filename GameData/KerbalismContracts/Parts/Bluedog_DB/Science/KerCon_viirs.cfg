  description = VIIRS (Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite) imagers typically observe a wildfire at a given location a few times a day. It can map fires and burn scars with high accuracy. The optical and thermal bands, which detect reflected and radiated energy, provide daytime visible imagery and night-time information on active fires. VIIRS also provides nighttime fire detection capabilities through its Day-Night Band, which can measure low-intensity visible light emitted by small and fledgling fires.
