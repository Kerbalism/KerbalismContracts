# KerbalismContracts

A contract pack that builds on top of Kerbalism.

## Radiation fields

Magnetic fields and radiation belts need to be researched before they will become visible. There is a mission for each body that has you send a probe with a radiation sensor to go looking for things like radiation belts and magnetospheres. Some bodies don't have them, others do - it is your job to find out if there are any, and where they are. You won't see those fields in the map view unless you researched them. Fields are discovered independently, so you might see an inner belt but not know about the outer belt until later.

# Plans for the future

## Solar observation

Your ability to look at the surface of the sun will influence the reliability and accuracy of CME warnings. If you're not observing the sun, you won't get CME warnings at all, and the predicted storm durations are wild guesses. If you observe 50% of the solar surface, you will get a warning for some storms, but not for all of them. And the predicted durations will be a bit more accurate. For reliable sun observations you will need to be looking at the sun from different angles, probably with 2 or more satellites on heliocentric orbits.

## Orbital Observation

Build a satellite network to provide orbital images on very short notice. That network will be used to measure the extent of oil spills, provide images of natural events in remote areas, track icebergs or detect forest fires. You'll have to act quickly, so plan your network wisely!

## Environmental Survey

Observe various biomes of your home planet with instruments that require very specific observation parameters: day, dusk, night, the sun must be at a specific angle over the surface to avoid glints, the altitude must be just right. Observing the sea needs different parameters than measuring the extent of forests or the temperature of the ice caps. Things you normally wouldn't care about in a normal KSP game.

## Communication Service

Provide constant radio coverage over a given area of your home planet. This will either be possible with geostationary orbits, or might require several satellites in molniya orbits for areas with higher longitudes. 

## Installation

You need the following mods:

* Module Manager
* Contract Configurator
* Kerbalism v3.1 or later
