# KerbalismContracts

**A contract pack for Kerbalism.**

The overall goal is to leave mission design (orbit choice, constellation design) to you, instead of forcing a particular solution (such as a specific orbit specified by the contract).

These contracts will test your skills. Gradually explore the depths of the Kerbin universe, discover radiation fields, learn how to build your first global satellite navigation system and provide satellite TV coverage.


## What it is about

Finding solutions to mission requirements that are very similar to real life. Most of these contracts require a basic understanding of orbital dynamics and astrophysics. You will need careful planning and the ability to execute your plan without much room for error. This time, moar boosters just won't cut it.

You will have to answer a set of questions: which orbit do you choose, and where? How many satellites do you need? Could it be less if you're being clever about it?


## Discover Radiation fields

Magnetic fields and radiation belts need to be researched before they will become visible. Radiation fields are discovered independently, so you might see an inner belt but not know about the outer belt until later. There are missions that have you send probes to run radiation scans from within the fields before they become visible in map view. Some bodies have very oddly shaped fields in unexpected locations - so good luck with that!


## TV Satellites

Have at least one satellite with a running UHF transponder directly above a given location at all times, without interruption, for an extended period of time. Sure, you think, you've done geostationary orbits before, right? Yes, there are contracts that can be done that way. But what if the location is not near the equator? Find a solution!


## Navigation Systems

Everybody knows GPS. But do you know its predecessor, and how it worked? Create your own networks of navigation
satellites that satisfy the unique demands of the technology they're built on!


## Observe the Earth

Build a satellite network with earth observing sensors for a wide range of applications: weather satellites, long term topology observations for agriculture, wildfire detection and tracking and many more!


## Observe the Sun

Launch new scientific missions to observe the sun. Find new orbits that allow uninterrupted solar observations for years, and for better predictions of solar activity, look at the solar surface from all directions.


## What it is not about

Easy money and easy science. These are not "put a vessel this orbit and then push a button" type of contracts. You will get a set of mission parameters, finding the solution is up to you.
