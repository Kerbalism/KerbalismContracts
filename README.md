# KerbalismContracts

**A contract pack for Kerbalism.**

These contracts will test your skills. Gradually explore the depths of the Kerbin universe, discover radiation fields, learn how to build your first global satellite navigation system and provide satellite TV coverage.

You probably already know about geosynchronous orbits and that they are used for TV satellites. But did you ever do that in KSP? Now you can!

## What it is about

Finding solutions to mission requirements that are very similar to real life. Most of these contracts require a basic understanding of orbital dynamics and astrophysics. You will need careful planning and the ability to execute your plan without much room for error. This time, moar boosters just won't cut it.

## What it is not about

Easy money and easy science. These are not "put a vessel this orbit and then push a button" type of contracts. You will get a set of mission parameters.
