# KerbalismContracts

A contract pack that builds on top of Kerbalism.

## Magnetic fields

Magnetic fields and radiation belts need to be researched before they will become visible. There is a mission for each body that has you send a probe with a radiation sensor to go looking for things like radiation belts and magnetospheres. Some bodies don't have them, others do - it is your job to find out if there are any, and where they are. You won't see those fields in the map view unless you researched them. Fields are discovered independently, so you might see an inner belt but not know about the outer belt until later.

## Solar observation

Your ability to look at the surface of the sun will influence the reliability and accuracy of CME warnings. If you're not observing the sun, you won't get CME warnings at all, and the predicted storm durations are wild guesses. If you observe 50% of the solar surface, you will get a warning for some storms, but not for all of them. And the predicted durations will be a bit more accurate. For reliable sun observations you will need to be looking at the sun from different angles, probably with 2 or more satellites on heliocentric orbits.

## Orbital Observation Network

Build a satellite network to provide orbital images on very short notice. That network will be used to measure the extent of oil spills, provide images of natural events in remote areas, track icebergs or detect forest fires. You'll have to act quickly, so plan your network wisely!

## Installation

You need the following mods:

* Module Manager
* Contract Configurator
* Kerbalism v3.1 or later
